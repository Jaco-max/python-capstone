# python-capstone-one\n
This is the first Capstone Project I did for the HyperionDev Software Engineering bootcamp.<br />
It basically entails using Python to create a simple program which allows a user to calculate two forms of Interest payable on Investments: Simple and Compound Interest.

The project incorporates use of the MATH Library in Python and how to layout output that is user friendly.<br />
It also introduces conditional statements such as ELIF and IF ELSE statements.
