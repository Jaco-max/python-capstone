HyperionDev Python Capstone Project
This is the first Capstone Project I did for the HyperionDev Software Engineering bootcamp.
It basically entails using Python to create a simple program which allows a user to calculate two forms of Interest payable on Investments: Simple and Compound Interest.

The project incorporates use of the MATH Library in Python and how to layout output that is user friendly. 
It also introduces conditional statements such as ELIF and IF ELSE statements.
